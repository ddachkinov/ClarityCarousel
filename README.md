IE Bootstrap Carousel
=====================

IE Bootstrap Carousel is a fork of Twitter's Bootstrap Carousel, which can be found here: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel.  It is intended to bring support for Twitter's Carousel to Internet Explorer 8 and 9.  It does so by adding jQuery animations for browsers that do not support CSS3 Transitions.
